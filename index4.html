            <h1>THEME: </h1>
            <p>The American Dream: Gatsby's relentless pursuit of wealth and status to win Daisy's love reflects the corrupted American Dream, where materialism and superficial success overshadow moral values.

                Class and Society: The novel explores the divide between old money (represented by the Buchanans) and new money (represented by Gatsby) in 1920s America.
                
                Illusion vs. Reality: Gatsby creates an illusion of himself and his past to fit into high society and win Daisy's affection, but this facade ultimately leads to tragedy.
                
                Love and Idealism: Gatsby's idealized love for Daisy contrasts sharply with the reality of their relationship, highlighting the gap between romantic dreams and harsh reality.
                
                Moral Decay: The novel critiques the moral decay and emptiness of the wealthy elite, who indulge in excess and hedonism while lacking empathy and moral integrity.
                
                "The Great Gatsby" is considered a masterpiece of American literature, renowned for its elegant prose, vivid portrayal of the Jazz Age, and profound exploration of the human condition and the complexities of the American Dream.
