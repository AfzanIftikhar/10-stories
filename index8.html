              <h3>
                Part1: Okonkwo's Rise

              </h3>
              <p>The novel begins with Okonkwo, a respected warrior and wrestler in Umuofia, known for his strength and <br> determination. He is haunted by the memory of his father, Unoka, who was lazy and unsuccessful. Okonkwo works tirelessly to build his wealth and reputation, eventually gaining multiple titles in the clan.</p>
              <h3>
                Part 2: Arrival of the Europeans  
              </h3>
              <p>The arrival of white missionaries and colonial government officials disrupts the traditional way of life in Umuofia. The missionaries introduce Christianity and gradually gain converts, including Okonkwo's own son, Nwoye, who rejects his father's beliefs. </p>
              <h3>
                Part 3: Conflict and Tragedy
              </h3>
              <p>Tensions rise between the traditional Igbo culture and the new influences brought by the Europeans. Okonkwo, resistant to change and desperate to maintain his clan's way of life, takes drastic actions to resist the colonizers. This leads to a tragic event where Okonkwo kills a British messenger, and the village leaders, fearing reprisals, do not support him</p>
              <h3>
                Part 4: Fall of Okonkwo</h3>
                <p> Okonkwo, realizing that his clan will not go to war against the British, hangs himself in despair. His suicide is a symbolic act of defiance against the colonizers but also reflects his inability to adapt to the changing world. The novel ends with the district commissioner arriving to write a book about the Igbo people's customs, trivializing their culture and history.</p>
