            <h1 style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px; position: relative ; left: 10px;" >A TALE OF TWO CITIES</h1>
            <p style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px; position: relative ; left: 10px;" >"A Tale of Two Cities" is a novel written by Charles Dickens, published in 1859. It is set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution. The story explores themes of resurrection, sacrifice, and the struggle for justice amidst tumultuous historical events. Here is a summary of the full story:</p>
            <h1 style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px; position: relative ; left: 10px;" >Book the First: Recalled to Life</h1>
            <p style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px;  position: relative ; left: 10px;">The novel opens with the famous line, "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..." and introduces the contrasting cities of London and Paris during the late 18th century. The central characters are introduced: Dr. Manette, a French physician who was unjustly imprisoned in the Bastille for eighteen years; his daughter Lucie Manette, who thought her father dead until she discovered and reunited with him in London; and Charles Darnay, a French aristocrat who rejects his family's cruel legacy and moves to England under an assumed name to live a new life.</p>
            <h1 style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">Book the Second: The Golden Thread</h1>
            <p style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">Years later, Darnay returns to France to help an old family servant, Gabelle, who has been imprisoned by the revolutionaries. He is arrested in France on charges of being a spy for the English, due to his resemblance to another man, and sentenced to death by guillotine. However, he is saved by his look-alike, Sydney Carton, a dissolute English lawyer who has fallen in love with Lucie. Carton masterminds Darnay's escape and takes his place in prison, knowing that he and Darnay bear an uncanny resemblance.</p>
            <h1 style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">Book the Third: The Track of a Storm</h1>
            <p style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">As the French Revolution intensifies, the lives of the characters are drawn into the chaos. Darnay is again arrested during the Reign of Terror, this time by revolutionaries who imprison and try him. Lucie, her daughter Little Lucie, and Dr. Manette, devastated by Darnay's imprisonment, turn to Sydney Carton for help. Carton devises a daring plan to save Darnay: he switches places with him once more, intending to sacrifice his own life to save Lucie's husband.

                Carton faces his fate with dignity, finding peace and redemption in his final moments. His selfless act allows Darnay to escape with his family back to England. The novel ends with one of the most famous closing lines in literature: "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."</p>
